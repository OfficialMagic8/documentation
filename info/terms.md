# Terms & Conditions

The Magic8 Discord Bot \("bot"\) is owned and developed by Fyrlex\#2740 and AlonsoAliaga\#0017 \("us"/"we"/"our"\). The following Terms & Conditions \("terms"\) are automatically followed when you use Magic8.

* You will not use Magic8 in harmful ways against other members of your servers.
* We may remove or ban the bot from your server at any time for what we consider inappropriate \(no racist or hate content for server names/images\).
* We may remove or ban the bot from your server if you are abusing commands or trying to break a feature.
* We may update your server data at any time if there is an issue with our database.
* We have a log system of every command that is used, the author and the server.
* All donations to Magic8 through through any payment method are donations that cannot be refunded. Chargebacks ban Magic8 from any server you are in. This includes all Premium Packages too.
* These terms, our Privacy statement, Premium Package contents and prices, may be changed at any time.
* We ask you to follow [Discord's Terms](https://discord.com/terms) as well.

## Privacy

We collect and store guild \(server\) data \(including the name and ID\), on Magic8 for settings and to monitor your usage of commands explicitly from Magic8. Most [settings](../commands/administrator/) have a default value and _any_ updated settings are stored in order to save your preferences \(language, prefix etc.\) for the bot. Your data is only used in your server but we may check it at any time for testing purposes or modifications \(if we change what kind of data is stored\). Your data will not be given to any third-party service. You may request to view or delete your data at any time by contacting Fyrlex\#2740 on Discord.

#### Mincraft Server IP/Host Feature

The Minecraft Server IP address or domain name you set will be secured in our Database. It will not be used for any other reason besides when someone in your server uses the `mcserver` command. You can remove your Minecraft Server IP from the Database at any time with `mcserver remove`.
