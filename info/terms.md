* We may update your [server data](terms.md#privacy) at any time if there is an issue with our database or is preferred by the developers.
* We have a log system of every command that is used, the author's and the server's name and ID are sent in this channel.

## Privacy

We collect and store guild \("server"\) data \(including the name and ID\), on Magic8 for settings and to monitor your usage \(including tag and ID\) of all commands explicitly from Magic8. Most [settings](../commands/administrator/) have a default value and _any_ updated settings are stored in order to save your preferences \(language, prefix etc.\) for the bot. Your data is only used in your server but we may check it at any time for testing purposes or modifications \(if we change what kind of data is stored\). Your data will not be given to any third-party service under any circumstance.

You may request to view or to delete your data at any time by contacting Fyrlex\#2740 on Discord.

#### Mincraft Server IP/Host Command

The Minecraft Server IP address or domain name you set will be secured in our Database. It will not be used for any other reason besides when someone in your server uses the `mcserver` command. You can remove your Minecraft Server IP from the Database at any time with `mcserver remove`.
