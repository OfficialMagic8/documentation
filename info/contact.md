# Contact Support

The developers have a friendly [Support Server](https://magic8.xyz/discord) that can happily assist you with Magic8. The developers enjoy hearing new ideas or discovering bugs that can be removed. English and Spanish are both spoken, but other languages are not fully supported. 

If Magic8 appears offline, you can always check the status [here](https://uptime.magic8.xyz/). If you would like to be notified of downtimes via email, please contact a developer.

**Developers:** Fyrlex\#2740 & AlonsoAliaga\#0017
