# Languages

The developers of Magic8 have spent the past few weeks moving all messages into this repository. In addition, Magic8 directly pulls its languages from here and works pretty fast. Come join the project and help translate Magic8!

\*_Please note that we are **not** looking for complete translations! Although we'd greatly appreciate that, we aren't rushing you to complete the entire English file translated in one night._

\*_Please also note that **English** is the most accurate and up to date language. It is up to other translators to match their languages with the English file. We have a **News Channel** in our_ [_Support Server_](https://magic8.xyz/discord) _that posts all updates of the **en.json** file._

### Instructions

* Create a fork of this repository or store the English file \([en.json](https://github.com/OfficialMagic8/Languages/blob/master/languages/en.json)\) file on your computer
* Please make sure you are familiar with [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON) format, [arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array), [objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects) and [strings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)
* Please make sure you understand all of [Markdown](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline-)
* Translate the English to your fluently known language
* Submit a pull request or send a file to be reviewed and then approved

### Rules/Guidelines

* Follow [updates](https://github.com/OfficialMagic8/Languages/commits/master/languages/en.json) for the English file \([en.json](https://github.com/OfficialMagic8/Languages/blob/master/languages/en.json)\)
* Do not edit the contents of the placeholders, "{EXAMPLE}", move them accordingly for grammar purposes
* Do **NOT** use a translating service if you don't understand the language you are writing in \(don't pretend you know a language\)
* If you are fluent in another language, you are permitted to use a translator only to help you understand the English, please correct any errors from the translator
* If you feel that you may need some help translating, either contact support or use the recommended translator, [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/en/translator)
* Please do **NOT** change the meanings of translations
* If a user reports a translation and we discover that it is in fact a misleading/irrelevant translation, you will be held responsible and punished 

### Possible Rewards

* Language Contributor Role in our [Support Server](https://magic8.xyz/discord)
* Free [Triple Package](https://docs.magic8.xyz/info/premium#triple-package-usd-8-99-one-time-forever)
* Advertisement on the Magic8 bot or in the \#sponsors channel
* Complete credit for the language
* Utmost respect from the developers
* Possibly more

Please only translate files to your known language if you are already **somewhat fluent** in English. This way, you can understand the grammar and make proper changes. If you ever have a question about a word or phrase, do not hesitate to contact support.

There are still quite a few commands that do not support translations. It is tedious work that will be done when the developers have the time to do so.

### Placeholders Information

To get data that can't be translated, placeholders are used in the form of {PLACEHOLDER}. Again, please do not edit these at all, only move them for grammatical purposes.

Here is a list of the global placeholders \(placeholders that are always the same everywhere\). Be sure to check for updates here!

| Placeholder | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| {CHECK} | Green Check Emoji |
| {CROSS} | Red Cross Emoji |
| {INFO} | Info Emoji |
| {LOADING} | Loading Emoji |
| {WARNING} | Warning Emoji |
| {BOT} | @Magic8 |
| {BOTNAME} | Magic8 |
| {INVITE} | Support Server Invite |
| {PREFIX} | Server Prefix |
| {USER} | Message Author |
| {USERNAME} | Username e.g. Fyrlex |

If you do not understand a placeholder, please contact support.
