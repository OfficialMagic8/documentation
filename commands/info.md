# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

In the following articles, you will be given the command, usage, aliases and a brief description. When encountering `<>` or `[]`, do not actually type those characters. The `<>` means **required** and `[]` means **optional**. Any time you see a word like `this`, it is usually referring to a command or alias. If you see `|` between two or more words, it means those are your options.

{% hint style="info" %}
To view specific command information, type`m!help <command>` to receive a small help menu of the command.
{% endhint %}

A prefix must be typed before any command or alias, you can check your server's prefix by @mentioning the bot in your server.

The Usage column provides examples on what you would type after the command name. &lt;user&gt; always means @mention someone.

### Example

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left">Name</th>
      <th style="text-align:left">Usage</th>
      <th style="text-align:left">Information</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">8ball</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">&lt;question&gt;</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p><b>Aliases:</b>  <code>8b, ball</code>
        </p>
        <p><b>Description:</b> Ask a question and get a response</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

You can type the command or any alias after your prefix to run the command. You will have to type a `<question>` to use the command successfully.

```text
m!8ball Hi, are you a good bot?
```

All commands and aliases are **not** case sensitive and do not require the command to be directly after the prefix. The following is an example of what **will** work.

```text
m! Help
```

{% hint style="success" %}
All commands in every category **except** Information and Administrator can be toggled using: `m!settings toggle <command>`
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If no usage is provided for a command, a menu is usually sent or there simply isn't anything to provide.
{% endhint %}
