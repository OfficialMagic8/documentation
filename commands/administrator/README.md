# ðŸ‘® Administrator Commands

## General Information

These commands can be accessed by all users with `Manage Server` permission. If you were to kick Magic8 then reinvite, your settings will still be saved.

## Anti-Ping

The Anti-Ping system is a method of preventing users from @mentioning a specified user. There are also bypass roles that can be set. For example, you'd set the staff roles of your server to be a bypass role.

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is actually impossible to prevent a user from pinging another. This system simply deletes the message and warns the user with a message you can customize.
{% endhint %}

**Base Command:** `prefix` or `pf`
